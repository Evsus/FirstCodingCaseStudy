# Course Goals

In this class, each student will learn a new programming language of their choice. However, building skills in the language that you choose is only one goal of the course.

Another vitally important goal is to understand the designs, implementations, and characteristics of programming languages in general.

This means that each student's language is a kind of case study for everyone in the class. Much of our class time will be dedicated to discussion of the PLs. Before class, you must read the assigned materials and think about how they apply to your PL. In class, you will be expected to describe your PL and demonstrate code in terms of the reading concepts. You must also be a good audience, for you will be responsible for understanding and applying the findings of your classmates.

A third major course goal is to learn and apply professional practices in the development of software. The reading assignments include many guidelines and checklists of good programming practices. The programs that you write for this course will be evaluated against this ever-rising bar. You will do this through a substantial programming project.

The final goal to discuss here is independent learning. Prepare yourself for the following challenges.

* Each student will focus on a different PL, and I your instructor will not be expert in all of them.
* The topics to be covered in this class will apply to different PLs in different ways, perhaps not at all in some cases.
* The topics in this course are interrelated. No matter what order we study the concepts, we will encounter related concepts before we have studied them in detail.

Your immediate tasks, to be completed by our next class meeting, are as follows.

1. Pick a programming language that you are interested in learning. Don't pick a language that you have previous experience with. You must coordinate with your classmates so that we will have a balanced set of languages as case studies.
1. Find at least one implementation of that language to use for the class. In other words, install a set of tools so that you can write and execute programs in your language in our class meetings.
1. Identify information sources for learning more about your language: Web sites, books, etc.
