# Circle Parameters

(Adapted from *Introduction to Programming with Java: A Problem-Solving Approach*, Dean and Dean, McGraw-Hill.)

Write a program that generates and prints circle-related values. Read in a value for radius. Calculate and print the corresponding values for diameter, circumference, and area. If available, use a built-in programming language constant for the value of Ï€. 

```
Enter a radius value: 2.5

Diameter = 5.0
Circumference = 15.707963267948966
Area = 19.634954084936208
```
