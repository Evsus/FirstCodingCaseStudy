# Contribution Guidelines

The code and test data that you submit for this course should generally follow the guidelines below, as they are introduced in readings and discussions.

Programs are generally graded as follows. (Adapted from Jack Lynch's *Getting an A on an English Paper*.)

**A** programs are the very best. They not only do nothing wrong; they show real elegance, style, and precision.

**B** programs have no serious problems with respect to any of the guidelines below.

**C** programs have serious problems with respect to one or more of the guidelines below.


**D** programs have serious problems with respect to multiple guidelines below.

**F** programs show a lack of honest effort and/or are plagiarized.

In general, you may resubmit your programs for re-grading. Your initial and final grades will be averaged.

## General Quality Criteria

1. All problems identified by software tools are resolved.
2. The program contains no unneeded statements.
3. The codeâ€™s formatting eases reading, is consistent, and follows the program logic.
4. The program is documented appropriately.

## Correctness

5. The program satisfies all requirements of the problem or assignment.
6. All output is clear, well formatted, and correct.
7. The program always terminates gracefully.
8. All logic paths of the program have been tested.
9. All boundary conditions of the program have been tested.
10. The program has been tested with invalid data values and types.

## Variables and Data

11. Variables have the smallest scope possible.
12. Variables have clear names that refer to the problem, not to programming concepts.
13. Each variable has a single purpose.
14. There are no unused variables.
15. Variables have appropriate data types.
16. Symbolic names are used in place of numeric literals, except 0 and 1.

## Control Structures, Nesting, and Blocks

17. Post-test loops are used when appropriate.
18. Appropriate loop types are used for definite vs. indefinite iteration.
19. Boolean values are not explicitly compared to true or false.
20. All blocks are short enough to conveniently view at one time.
21. Nesting is as shallow as reasonably possible.

## Routines (Functions and Procedures)

22. Procedure names are descriptive- usually in verbObject format.
23. Function names are descriptive- usually of return value.
24. Each routine has one well-defined purpose.
25. Routines are created to improve readability and avoid repetition.
26. Each routine uses all of its arguments.

## ADTs, Classes, Objects

27. Each ADT is clearly named, describing a single well-defined purpose.
28. Each ADT initializes all its data at the time it is created.
29. Each ADT hides its implementation details and internal data.
